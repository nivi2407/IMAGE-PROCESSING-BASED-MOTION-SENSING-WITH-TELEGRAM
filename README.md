# IMAGE-PROCESSING-BASED-MOTION-SENSING-WITH-TELEGRAM
## An algorithm for moving object detection from video sequences. Motion detection software is widely preferred as one of the most important security features in recent days. It is used to enhance existing security devices such as motion sensor lighting on indoor and outdoor security cameras. Security cameras are one of the most common devices that use motion detection technology. Now, for better protection, motion detector cameras are preferred. The paper suggested here looks at one of the python motion detection software and detects the movement of human, cat or dog in front of the camera. Here we propose a new method for the movement detection using a neural network model. We establish a reliable background updating model by using threshold methods to detect complete moving objects. By using neural network and image processing techniques, once the movements are detected the used method will quickly capture the video and send it to the admin via telegram chat bot. The communication can be made with telegram via bot by retrieving image and video in real time.
